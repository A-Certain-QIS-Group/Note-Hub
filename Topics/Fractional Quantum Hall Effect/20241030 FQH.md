# Fractional Hall Effect

## Experiment
![](images/FQH_experiment.png)


## Methodology
- instead of writing down a model Hamiltonian and solve it
- we first write down a **wavefunction ansatz**, 
- then construct a **parent Hamiltonian** that annihilates the wavefunction ansatz
    - which is usually a sum of non-commuting local projectors
- finally, we argue if the physical system falls into the **"universality class"** of such model Hamiltoians
## Motivation
- When talking single particle orbits, we are actually talking about...
    - multi-particle wavefunction built from single particle orbits
        - $ψ(x_i) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}\det(ψ_i(x_j))$
        - antisymmetric under switch of any pair of $x_i ↔ x_j$
- Free electrons under magnetic field
    - lowest landau levels in angular momentum basis
        - $ψ_m(z) ∼ z^{m-1}e^{-|z|^2/4l_B^2}$
            - a ring of radius $r=\sqrt{2m} l_B$
    - the wavefunction resembles the Vandermonde determinant $\det(z_j^{i-1}) = ∏\limits_{i<j}(z_i-z_j)$:
        - $ψ(z_i) ∼ ∏\limits_{i<j}(z_i-z_j)e^{-∑_i|z_i|^2/4l_B^2}$
        - the exponential term is just the wavepacket of center of mass
## Laughlin Wavefunction
- Laughlin Wavefunction is the generalization of Vandermonde determinant
    - $ψ(z) ∝ ∏\limits_{i<j}(z_i-z_j)^me^{-∑_i|z_i|^2/4l_B^2}$
        - holomorphic polynomial $\tilde ψ(z) = ∏\limits_{i<j}(z_i-z_j)^m$
    - $ν=\frac{1}{m}$ is the filling rate of the first landau level
        - $n=\frac{1}{2πl_B^2 m}$
    - the relative angular momentum between particles i and j is m
## Parent Hamiltonian
- Parent Hamiltonian
    - $H=∑\limits_{m'=1}^∞∑\limits_{i<j} v_{m'} P_{m'}(ij) + ωJ$
        - $P_{m'}(ij)$ is projection onto the relative angular momentum $m$ sector of particles i and j.
        - $v_{m'} = \begin{cases} 1 & m'<m \\ 0 & m'≥m\end{cases}$
            - gaps out states where i and j are too close to each other
            - finite energy gap ⟹ imcompressible fluid
        - $ωJ$ is a gentle compressing term to force the system to choose the most compact state that was annihilated by all the local projectors
            - $J$ total angular momentum operator
            - which is $\frac12 m N(N-1)$ for Laughlin state
## Excitations
- Ansatz for excitations
    - $\tilde ψ(z;η,η') ∝ \left(∏\limits_\text{q-holes}∏\limits_i (z_i-η_j)\right)\left(∏\limits_\text{q-particles} ∏\limits_i (2∂_i-\bar η'_j)\right)\tilde ψ(z)$
        - $\tilde ψ(z_i)=∏\limits_{i<j}(z_i-z_j)^m$, excluding the exponential factor $e^{-∑_i|z_i|^2/4l_B^2}$
- a quasi-hole at $η$ → a $∏\limits_i(z_i-η)$ prefactor
    - repels other electrons
        - $ψ(z_i=η)=0$
    - overlapping of m quasi-holes simulates the repelling effect of a non-existential particle, as if that particle is taken away artificially: a full-sized hole
- a quasi-particle at $η'$ → a $∏\limits_i(2\tilde ∂_i-\bar η')$ "prefactor"
    - $\tilde ∂$ only acts on the polynomial $\tilde ψ$, not the exponential factor
- other neutral excitations
    - rotons
    - magneto-rotons
## Plasma Analogy
- by matching with the partitional function of a classical plasma model
    - $⟨ψ|[⋅]|ψ⟩=∫d^{2N}z [⋅] |ψ(z)|^2 = ∫d^{2N}z [⋅] e^{-βU}$
- $U = -\log \sum\limits_{i<j}|z_i-z_j| + \frac{1}{4m} ∑\limits_i |z_i|^2$
    - $l_B=1$
    - first term = Coulomb interaction between two particles of charge $-1$
    - second term = potential generalized by a constant background charge density $ρ_0=\frac{1}{2πl_B^2m}$ in opporite sign
- the system is homogeneous
    - the $|z_i|^2$ term originates from the choice of origin as potential reference point in the bacnground charge density
- minimal energy required by neutralizing the charge density
    - $n=\frac{1}{2πl_B^2 m}$ = $1/m$ of Landau level density
- $β=2m$ effective (inverse) "temperature"
    - $m⪅70$ ⟹ liquid-like
    - $m⪆70$ ⟹ solid-like
- quasi hole = inntroducing a repulsive potential from an impurity of charge -1/m
    - $ΔU = -\frac{1}{m}∑\limits_i \log|z_i-η|$
    - compared to average particle density, one quasi hole pushes out 1/m particles of a total charge -1/m ⟹ a charge +1/m hole
- screening
    - mobile particles rearrange around the impurity, hiding the effect of the immpurity from long distance
    - because of the long distance nature of electrical potential in 2D, the screen is done within a finite radius, with expnential falloff $e^{-r/λ_D}$
        - $λ_D$: Debye Screnning Length
            - $λ_D∝\sqrt{1/β}$
- effective partition function between impurities
    - the difference between effective potential for laughlin wavefunction vs the correct plasma model
        - $U_\text{plasma} ∼ U(z,z) + U(z,η) + U(η,η) + U(z) + U(η)$
            - where $U(η,η) is the interactions between the bare charge of the impurities
        - $U_\text{Laughlin} ∼ U(z,z) + U(z,η) + U(z)$
    - the partition function of the plasma model should be insensitive to impurities 
        - $∂_η U_\text{plasma} = 0, |η_i-η_j| ≫ λ_D$ 
            - because of screening effect

## Composite Fermions
- the quasi objects can further form Laughlin State and being further decomposed into quasi-quasi particles
    - fusion category?

    - Haldane Pseudopotential is the expectation value of Potential under angular momentum eigenvalues:
        - $v_m = \frac{⟨M,m|V|M,m⟩}{⟨M,m|M,m⟩} ≈ V(r=\sqrt{2m}l_B)$



<!-- ### Supplimental: Dirac Quantization Condition
- On a $L_x×L_y$ torus
        - $e^{-i D_x L_x}e^{-iD_y L_y} = e^{-i D_y L_y}e^{-i D_x L_x}$
                - $D_μ = ∂_μ - i A e/ħ$
                - > TODO check convention
        - It requires total magnetic flux to be quantized
                - $B L_x L_y / Φ_0 ∈ ℤ, Φ_0=2πħ/e$

### Supplimental: Chiral Anomaly
- chiral anomaly: you cant have charged particles moving along a wire. there has to be particles which can move in the opposite direction as well. also see Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem -->
